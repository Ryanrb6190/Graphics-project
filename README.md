Please download from my university onedrive:


I was having a lot of problems uploading the file to github and using the LFS.

After cloning the repository, I had to run the MainScene scene asset in Assets/Scenes for it to work.
However it was very buggy.

I have just receieved an email saying that my LPS has been disabled and I dont know how else to upload the file other than through onedrive.
